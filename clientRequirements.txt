Project from Client:

An adventure gaming startup company wants to create a simple Text-Based Adventure Game as a prototype
for their future game development projects. The game should allow the player to explore different areas, 
interact with objects, and make decisions that affect the outcome of the game. The client wants this game 
to be purely text-based and simple for players to understand but with engaging gameplay and a variety of choices.



Client's Expectations:

1. The game should be easy to navigate through text commands.
2. The game world should have at least 5 different locations (e.g., forest, cave, village, castle, dungeon).
3. Players should be able to move between locations and perform actions such as picking up items or engaging in simple combat.
4. The game should provide feedback on each decision, whether itâ€™s moving to a new location, picking up items, or fighting enemies.
5. Players should have a limited number of attempts or resources (like health points) to make progress, which adds challenge to the game.
6. Players should be able to win or lose the game based on their choices.
7. The game should be replayable with some random elements to keep it fresh.
